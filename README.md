## Overview
This project is the front-end for the Team It application.

Team It is an app for youth sport coaches to quickly communicate with families. Team It allows youth sports coaches to create a new team and then add followers to the team. Once a coach has added followers to a team, they can quickly communicate to all the team followers by sending a text to the application number 1-205-639-0334.

To find the team code, visit the teams page.
